# What the RAGCHECKER IS. Acknowledge limitations too
METHODOLGY = ("""
How it works (knowledge triplets and claim-level entailment)
- RefChecker breaks down the claims in the LLM’s response into knowledge triplets, as opposed to paragraph, sentence or sub-sentence. Detecting at knowledge triplets will test the truthfulness of facts. Importantly, this finer granularity subsumes other coarse granularity and is therefore more informative and precise. One can arbitrarily roll up the granularity ladder to derive coarse level metrics if needed.
- RAGChecker adopts this finer-grained methodology and performs claim extraction for both the ground-truth answer (GT) and the model response, then runs claim-level entailment checks against retrieved context and between GT↔response.

Core comparisons
1) Response ↔ GT answer: correctness (precision), completeness (recall), F1.
2) GT answer ↔ Retrieved ("retrieved → answer"): retriever coverage and noise.
   - Per-claim verdict: supported (entailed), insufficient_evidence (neutral), contradicted.
   - Per-chunk label: relevant (supports ≥1 GT claim) vs irrelevant (used/ignored).
   - Aggregates: claim_recall, context_precision.
3) Response ↔ Retrieved: generator faithfulness and error types.
   - correct_in_relevant / incorrect_in_retrieved (faithful but wrong) vs
     correct_not_in_retrieved (self-knowledge) / incorrect_not_in_retrieved (hallucination).
4) Optional directions: response2answer and answer2response claim checks for asymmetries.

Modes
- Joint check: allows combining evidence across multiple chunks (faster, pragmatic).
- One-by-one check: evaluates each chunk independently (slower, sometimes slightly more accurate).

Limitations
- LLM entailment can misjudge paraphrases, numbers/dates, temporal qualifiers, and multi-hop logic.
- Chunking (size/overlap) affects coverage and labels; duplicates can inflate counts if not deduped.
- Faithfulness ≠ correctness if retrieval is wrong/noisy.
- Non-English/domain jargon may reduce label reliability; missing fields limit metric coverage.

IMPROVMENT_STRATEGIES = ("""
Heuristics and common pitfalls
- Count at the claim level; deduplicate identical or trivially paraphrased claims across chunks.
- Separate "faithful but wrong" (incorrect_in_retrieved) from hallucination (not in any chunk).
- In joint mode allow cross-chunk support; in one-by-one do not combine across chunks.
- Attribute chunk relevance by GT coverage, not by usage in response.
- Watch numeric/date drift, entity resolution, and aggregation claims.
- Prefer compact lists with doc_id/query_id; cap long texts when presenting examples.

Key findings from RAGChecker (empirical observations)
- Retriever matters consistently: a stronger retriever (e.g., E5-Mistral vs BM25) lifts overall precision/recall/F1 with the generator fixed; benefit is largely generator-agnostic.
- Larger generator models (e.g., Llama3-70B vs 8B) improve generator metrics across the board: higher context utilization, lower noise sensitivity, fewer hallucinations.
- Context utilization strongly correlates with overall F1 and tends to be stable across different retrievers; improving retriever recall therefore improves overall recall/F1 while utilization remains a key driver.
- More informative context (higher claim recall) increases faithfulness and reduces hallucination/self-knowledge: generators can identify and leverage relevant evidence when it is present.
- Trade-off: as retriever claim recall increases, generators become more sensitive to noise because fixed-size chunks carry mixed signal; models exhibit chunk-level faithfulness and tend to trust relevant chunks as a whole. Relevant-noise sensitivity is typically higher than irrelevant-noise sensitivity.
- Model family gap: GPT-4 shows higher utilization and lower noise sensitivity than several open-source baselines; open-source models are faithful but more likely to trust context blindly as retrieval improves—suggests need for stronger reasoning/verification.

Settings and tuning suggestions (diagnosed with RAGChecker)
- Increase top-k and chunk size moderately to improve claim recall, faithfulness, and F1; expect a small increase in noise sensitivity and eventual saturation as total relevant information is fixed.
- Prompting with explicit requirements (cite/use provided context, be faithful, avoid unsupported claims) improves faithfulness and often utilization, but can increase noise sensitivity—balance per goals.
- Chunk overlap generally has minor effect: may raise context precision slightly without meaningfully changing claim recall; overlapping similar chunks rarely add new information.
- With limited total context budget: prefer larger chunks with fewer chunks for better context precision; if prioritizing utilization or reduced noise sensitivity, consider smaller chunks and tuned top_k/reranking to focus on maximally relevant material.
- Generator tuning involves a trilemma among utilization, noise sensitivity, and faithfulness—prioritize according to product goals and user preferences.

Formulas and calculations
Overall
- precision = correct_claims / (correct_claims + incorrect_claims)
- recall    = correct_claims / (correct_claims + missing_claims)

Retriever
- context_precision = relevant_chunks / (relevant_chunks + irrelevant_chunks_used + irrelevant_chunks_ignored)
- claim_recall      = (correct_claims_in_relevant + missing_claims_in_relevant) / (correct_claims + missing_claims)

Generator
- context_utilization             = correct_claims_in_relevant / (correct_claims_in_relevant + missing_claims_in_relevant)
- noise_sensitivity_in_relevant   = incorrect_claims_in_relevant / total_response_claims
- noise_sensitivity_in_irrelevant = incorrect_claims_in_irrelevant / total_response_claims
- hallucination                   = incorrect_claims_not_in_any_chunk / total_response_claims
- self_knowledge                  = correct_claims_not_in_any_chunk / total_response_claims
- faithfulness                    = (correct_claims_in_relevant + incorrect_claims_in_retrieved) / total_response_claims

Notes: Prefer micro-averaging across claims/chunks unless a macro flag is provided; deduplicate identical claims to avoid double counting.
