I need help fixing a React TypeScript component that's not rendering progress bars correctly. The component shows only an "i" in a circle instead of the expected metric dashboard.

**CONTEXT:**
- React + TypeScript frontend for a RAG evaluation dashboard
- Component should show metrics in three cards with colored progress bars
- Progress bars should use HSL colors from red (0) to green (120) based on performance
- Some metrics have `lowerIsBetter: true` which inverts the color calculation

**CURRENT ISSUE:**
The RunOverview component renders but only shows an info icon instead of progress bars. The component should display three cards (Overall Metrics, Retriever Metrics, Generator Metrics) with colored progress bars for each metric.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
I need the complete RunOverview.tsx file that:
1. Takes a `run` prop of type `RunData`
2. Displays metrics in a 3-column grid layout
3. Each metric shows a progress bar colored from red (poor) to green (excellent)
4. Uses HSL color calculation: `hue = lowerIsBetter ? (1 - value) * 120 : value * 120`
5. Progress bar width should be the percentage value
6. Includes hover tooltips on info icons
7. Shows "* Lower values are better" for inverted metrics

**DATA STRUCTURE:**
```typescript
interface RunData {
  collection: string;
  timestamp: string; 
  file_origin: string;
  metrics: {
    overall_metrics: {
      precision: number;
      recall: number;
      f1: number;
    };
    retriever_metrics: {
      claim_recall: number;
      context_precision: number;
    };
    generator_metrics: {
      context_utilization: number;
      noise_sensitivity_in_relevant: number; // lowerIsBetter
      noise_sensitivity_in_irrelevant: number; // lowerIsBetter  
      hallucination: number; // lowerIsBetter
      self_knowledge: number;
      faithfulness: number;
    };
  };
  results: Question[];
}
```

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Values can be 0-1 or 0-100, need normalization
- HSL color: `hsl(${hue}, 85%, 45%)`
- Progress bars with `h-2.5` height
- Hover effects with `translateY(-5px)` and shadow
- Tooltips with SVG info icons
- Three-column responsive grid

Please provide the complete RunOverview.tsx component that will properly render the metric dashboard with colored progress bars.
